# hello-world

Hi Humans!

James is in the house. That's right. Right here.
I'm just learning how to use GitHub and the creation of this file is part of that learning.
Today I fiddled with learning how to set up Atom and create some snippets.
Lately, I've been learning how to utilize Unix for OS X and I've written a few scripts for myself.
Trying to keep things coordinated between my desktop and laptop computers is slightly challenging.
